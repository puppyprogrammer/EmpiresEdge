## 🌍 What Is *Empire’s Edge*?

*Empire’s Edge* is an online multiplayer idle strategy game where survival—not domination—is the goal.

You begin as the leader of a fledgling nation, occupying a single tile on a massive 100x100 world map shared by other real players. Your task isn’t just to expand—it's to *endure*, *negotiate*, and *evolve*.

This isn’t about racing to the top of a leaderboard. It's about building systems that last. You’ll need to manage infrastructure, form alliances, and make hard choices about how to protect your sovereignty in a world of shifting borders, fragile diplomacy, and resource-driven conflict.

## 🧠 Game Philosophy

- **Survival over conquest**: Aggression can be useful—but it can also attract coalitions and burn your resources.
- **Diplomacy is essential**: Trust and betrayal shape the map. Players who can navigate relationships gain influence without bloodshed.
- **Infrastructure is power**: Roads don’t just connect your empire—they allow expansion, movement, and cultural pressure.
- **Systems thinking wins**: Long-term planning beats short-term greed. Building resilient networks of trade, defense, and influence is key.

You’re not just building an empire. You’re *defending your right to exist*.
